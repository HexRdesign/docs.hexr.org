# Welcome to PlanVIEW!

*PlanVIEW* is an application that helps you organize and access information faster. This will save you time while studying and doing homework. In our clean user-interface, you will be able to quickly navigate to websites and take notes

# Link Setup


A major utility of *PlanVIEW* is to be able to access your teacher’s websites. As technology is meshing with education, teachers have found it easier to put documents and reminders on their personal websites which their students can vie

1. Open the application and navigate to the Settings.

2. In Settings, you can fill out the input boxes to save your links. Simply open up your teacher’s website in your browser and copy the link. Then paste it in the corresponding block’s box

3. You MUST fill out all the boxes. *PlanVIEW* requires all the boxes to be filled out.
Once you finish, click Save and if successful, it should give you an alert saying             “Settings Saved”.
    * If the alert says “There was an error”, look back and see if you filled out all the boxes
    * Remember that the boxes have to be filled out with a proper link. This means
        http://www.cnn.com/ and not just www.cnn.com .

Now that your links are setup, you don't need to bookmark them or type them up. Simply click on *PlanVIEW*, open up the menu and click the block you wish to go to.
